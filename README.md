### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Wojtek (Voytek) and I'm a ... lot of things. Primarly a software developer and a bucket of never implemented ideas. 

I do a bit of everything but mostly Functional Programming, microsevices and formerly Big Data processing. All of that with the magificent language of Scala ðŸ§™ and Typescript ðŸ¥¶.

I'm also a conference speaker sometimes! You may want to check out [the list of my presentations](https://w.pitula.me/presentations/) ([repo](https://github.com/Krever/presentations)) or my almost-never-updated [blog](https://w.pitula.me/#blog) ([repo](https://github.com/Krever/krever.github.io)).

Some time ago I translated great [Functional Programming for Mortals](https://leanpub.com/fpmortals) book into [Polish](https://leanpub.com/fpmortals-pl) ([repo](https://github.com/Krever/fpmortals-pl)). No one knows why though. ðŸ˜…

Unfortunately, you won't find anything else interesating here. This profile is the home of forks, failed experiments and half-baked projects that never saw a user. ðŸ¤·

I'm located in [Gdansk ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±](https://goo.gl/maps/7f7eFLmxBvNTzbx28), so if you're around and want to chat, just let me know. I'm always happy to make some new friends.
