### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Wojtek (Voytek) and currently I hold a title of Staff Engineer at SwissBorg. 

Unfortunately, you won't find anything very interesating here. This profile is the home of forks, failed experiments and half-baked projects that never saw a user. ðŸ¤·

Sometimes I speak at conferences and all my talks are available [here](https://w.pitula.me/presentations/) ([repo](https://github.com/Krever/presentations)). I also write on [medium](https://medium.com/@w.pitula).

At some point I translated [Functional Programming for Mortals](https://leanpub.com/fpmortals) book into [Polish](https://leanpub.com/fpmortals-pl) ([repo](https://github.com/Krever/fpmortals-pl)) but no one knows exactly why.

I'm located in [Gdansk ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±](https://goo.gl/maps/7f7eFLmxBvNTzbx28), so if you're around and want to chat, just let me know. I'm always happy to make some new friends.

Oh, I almost forgot. I do a lot of ðŸ’©-posts at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Krever01)!
